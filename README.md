- 👋 Hi, I’m Joe!
- 👀 I’m interested in using predictive analytics to realise commercial opportunities. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for an MSc in Compsci with Data and Analytics at the university of york.
My background is in commercial strategy at large consumer goods organisations including Mars and Molson Coors
- 💞️ I’m interested in collaborating on anything relating to application of machine learning/AI in commercial modelling. 
My experience in commercial settings is highly relevant to briding the gap between the technical implementation and the commercial context.
